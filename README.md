# estimating-batch-prices

This was a project that I made as an intern at Terracap. The objective was to create a methodology to price batches for economic evaluations. I used a confidential database, about commercialized batches in Distrito Federal, that is not available for the public.  It was used a linear regression model to the estimates as well. This code also makes a simple webscrapping that utilizes an API from google called Distance Matrix. This API can calculate the distance between any coordinates on a map.
